README

This project establishes an tree structure given a hierarchical coding
system. Once this tree structure is created it also computes the Euler
Circuit and corresponding levels in the tree [1]. The Euler Circuit
and the corresponding levels can be used to find lowest common
ancestors in the tree using range minimum queries. This application
was developed for the ICD-9 coding standard, but it is also
generalises to others.

The code is implemented in C++ using the boost libraries, in
particular the Boost Graph Library.


EXECUTION

The following command-line parameters are provided:

General Configuration:
  --help                produce help message
  --version             show the version

I/O Configuration:
  --result arg (=./results) results directory.
  --codes arg               CSV file with the codes.


The ICD-9 codes are expected to be in the following format for each
ICD-9 code:

Level-1, Level-2, ..., Level-n

Internally, a root vertex is created as a parent to all level-1
vertices in the input file. While the ICD-9 codes have balanced
levels, other coding systems might not. Internally, the names of the
vertices are prefixed with the current level. This is to ensure that
each vertex has a unique name.
